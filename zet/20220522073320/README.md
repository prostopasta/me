# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip").

* 1st bullet
* 2nd bullet

And numbered list:

1. Point one
2. Point two 

```go
package main

import fmt

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

What is I wnat *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like a code: `# sudo su` ?

And when I have a URL : https://rwx.gg


* I put references at the bottom
